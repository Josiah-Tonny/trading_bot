.

Subscription models commonly offer a 7‑day free trial, then tiers like ~$49–$99/month with varying signal counts and asset coverage .

Opportunity: Position your bot by offering multi-interval signals (5 min, 15 min, 4 hr, 24 hr), symbol-switching flexibility, and transparent performance stats.

🧩 2. Core Features — What You’ll Need
Signal Engine

Aggregate data via APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance).

Use indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands…) and optionally sentiment/news feeds 
docsbot.ai
.

Telegram Integration

Use python‑telegram‑bot to send signals with Entry/TP/SL.

For Telegram login, implement OAuth or rely on chat tied to Telegram IDs.

Subscription Management

7‑day trial with randomized or high-quality signals (limit 2–3/day).

Post-trial tiers (e.g., $10/mo = up to 3 signal picks, available every 5 min & 15 min weekly).

Per-symbol settings: changing symbol (+$1), adding symbol (+$3).

User Dashboard

UI via Flask (mobile-friendly) for subscription, symbol management, trade logs, and usage stats.

Performance Tracking

Provide users with metrics: win-rate, average gain, drawdown.

Transparency & trust: build your credibility.

Risk Management

TP/SL automatically calculated based on risk rules (e.g., ATR or % of current price).

Allow users to choose risk profiles.

✅ 4. Missing Elements to Add
Trading API integration (MT4/5, cTrader, or brokers) for optional auto-execution.

Payment gateway (Stripe or PayPal) integration for tiered subscriptions and pay-per-symbol fees.

Security & validation: rate limiting, endpoint auth, SSL/TLS, store only hashed tokens.

Scalability: Redis or Celery for background tasks (signal generation, notifications).

Compliance: disclaimer (“not financial advice”), covered by terms, and possibly logging/demos to prevent scams

Support & education: FAQs, tutorials, new-user guides, maybe video explaining indicators.

🕒 5. Timeline & Next Steps
MVP: build core features—signal engine, Telegram signals, Flask UI, subscription + payments.

Trial launch: small beta, collect performance data and feedback.

Refine: add auto-trading, UI improvements, risk profiles, symbol flexibility.

Scale: marketing, performance reporting, consider white-label (like FX Data Panel)

📌 Summary
Build a robust signal engine, Telegram bot, and Flask UI.

Offer clear subscription tiers & trial, with symbol control fees.

Add risk management, performance stats, and disclaimers for compliance.

Plan for scalability, payments, and optional auto-trading integration.


breakdown to help you flesh out both the signal algorithm side and the payment workflow integration:

🔍 1. Signal Algorithms
A. Technical Indicators & Logic
Use a hybrid indicator approach: combine moving averages (SMA/EMA) crossovers, MACD, RSI/Stochastic, Parabolic SAR, ADX for trend strength, and channel breakouts (e.g., Bollinger, Keltner, Donchian) 
investopedia.com
investopedia.com
+6
investopedia.com
+6
investopedia.com
+6
.

Design rules like:

5-min / 15-min: EMA crossover + RSI <30 (oversold) or >70 (overbought) + MACD signal-line cross.

4-hr / 24-hr: Use trend-strength filters like ADX >25, Parabolic SAR trend confirmation .

Signal generation:

Entry: All indicators align (e.g., EMA crossover + MACD bullish + ADX trend confirms).

Exit (TP/SL): Based on recent ATR multiple or channel boundaries, or Parabolic SAR trailing stop.

B. Custom Indicator Logic
Develop novel or hybrid indicators: e.g., combining price swing patterns with ATR-based channels, trading-breakouts and retracements 
investopedia.com
.

Example: trigger buy when:

Price crosses above upper Keltner band,

MACD crosses upward,

ADX indicates strong trend,

RSI is between 40–60 (avoiding extremes).

C. Backtesting & Optimization
Fetch historical OHLC via API.

Test various timeframes and indicator parameter sets.

Evaluate:

Win rate

Avg profit/loss

Max drawdown

Sharpe ratio

Optimize globally, but simplify rules to avoid overfitting

.

D. Multi-Timeframe Coordination
E.g., for a 15-min signal:

Fast: 5-min EMA crossover

Confirmation: 1-hr trend via 20-period EMA or ADX

💳 2. Payment Workflow Integration
A. Telegram Payments API
Use Telegram’s built-in payments API (e.g., Stripe, PayStar) to handle checkout securely, supporting:

One-time subscription

Payment callbacks (via webhooks)

Live mode via BotFather token 
reddit.com
+11
core.telegram.org
+11
github.com
+11
latenode.com

B. Subscription & Tier Logic
💰 Free Trial (7 days): enable basic signals (max 2–3/day).

Paid Tier ($10/mo): users pick max 3 signals/week on 5-min & 15-min intervals.

Symbol modification fees: implement in-bot commands like /change_symbol USDJPY that prompt a $1 or $3 payment via Telegram invoice.

Use Telegram webhooks or background task to monitor payments and adjust their subscription state accordingly.

C. Stripe / PayPal Integration via Webhooks
Use frameworks like aiogram + FastAPI to listen for webhook events and update user DB 
github.com
.

Optional helper platforms: Pipedream, Latenode, Pabbly to send Telegram notifications on payment events 
reddit.com
+11
pabbly.com
+11
latenode.com

.

D. Required Features Checklist
Payment success/failure callbacks

Recurring billing/subscription cancellation

Charges for add-on symbol changes

Support commands: /support, /terms, /status

Secure webhook endpoint, validate signatures

Handle disputes/chargebacks per provider documentation

  │   ├── change_symbol.py → charges extra fee
  │   └── webhook_update.py → updates subscription after payment event
F. Simplified Flow
User types /subscribe

Bot calls Stripe API, returning checkout link or Telegram-payment

Stripe confirms payment → webhook triggers → server updates user role and permissions

Bot sends confirmation message + access to signals

Symbol-change: user types command → bot sends invoice → updates when paid.

🧩 Next Steps
Choose: Stick with Telegram Payments or integrate Stripe/PayPal via bots involving more dev effort.

Design: Map subscription tiers and symbol-changing fees to commands/workflows.

Implement: Build webhook listener, Telegram invoicing flow, and test end-to-end with trial users.

Test & Launch: Cover events like success, failure, cancellation, refunds.

Monitor: Logging, analytics, support workflows.


	Plug in your DB logic, secure the endpoint (HTTPS), test all events (payments, cancellations, refunds).
Signal trades	Backtest the MACD+RSI logic on historical 15-minute OHLC data. Tune parameters for win-rate/drawdown.
Integration	Set up a scheduler (e.g., cron/Celery) to fetch live data, run the generate_signals() function, and send signal messages via Telegram with TP/SL.
TP/SL Calculations	Use ATR-based multiples for TP/SL placement. Add risk parameters per user profile.

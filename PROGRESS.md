1. Basic Signal Engine Skeleton
Start implementing the core logic for fetching data and generating signals.
Begin with stubs in data_fetcher.py and engine.py. 

2. Telegram Bot Integration
Set up a basic Telegram bot using python-telegram-bot in telegram_bot.py.
Make sure you can send a test message to your Telegram account.

3. Configuration Management
Ensure sensitive info (like your Telegram token) is loaded from .env using python-dotenv.

4. Version Control & Collaboration
Make sure your .gitignore is set up to ignore sensitive and unnecessary files.
Push your initial setup to GitHub so collaborators can pull and contribute.
